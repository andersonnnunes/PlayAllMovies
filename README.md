I made this script to make it easier to watch videos displayed on a tab but that are scattered over multiple directories.

My main media player is able to, with a button push, play the previous or the next file that is on the same folder of the currently open file. 

Directory Opus supports "virtual directories" (collections, find result, flat view). After opening a video file from one of these, it wasn't possible to jump to the next one easily from the player.

This script solves that problem.
